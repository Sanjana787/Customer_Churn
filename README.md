## Overview

Customer churn is a critical challenge, particularly in industries where customer retention is paramount, such as telecommunications, banking, and subscription-based services. This project involves:

- Data preprocessing and feature engineering.
- Building machine learning models to predict customer churn.
- Evaluating models using various performance metrics.
- Saving the best model for future predictions.

# Customer Churn Analysis

## Installation

To set up this project on your local machine, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the repository:**

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/customer-churn-analysis.git
    ```

2. **Navigate to the project directory:**

    ```bash
    cd customer-churn-analysis
    ```

3. **Create a virtual environment (optional but recommended):**

    ```bash
    python -m venv venv
    ```

4. **Activate the virtual environment:**

   - On Windows:
    
        ```bash
        venv\Scripts\activate
        ```
   - On macOS/Linux:

        ```bash
        source venv/bin/activate
        ```

5. **Install the necessary Python packages:**

    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

6. **Install Jupyter Notebook if you don't have it installed:**

    ```bash
    pip install notebook
    ```

## Usage

To run the project and perform customer churn analysis:

1. **Start Jupyter Notebook:**

    ```bash
    jupyter notebook
    ```

2. **Open the notebook:**

    In the Jupyter interface, navigate to `Customer_Churn.ipynb` and open it.

3. **Execute the analysis:**

    Run the cells in the notebook sequentially to perform the data analysis, model training, and evaluation.

4. **View the results:**

    The notebook will display various metrics, visualizations, and the final model's performance.

## Key Findings

- **Feature Importance:** Key features contributing to customer churn were identified through model analysis.
- **Churn Prediction:** The model can be used to predict customer churn with high accuracy, allowing businesses to take proactive steps in customer retention.
